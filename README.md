# Uniq
This is a fully-fleged version of an interview exercise I made for Vanta.
The exercise consist of recreating the default functionality of the Linux command `uniq`, with the caveat that this utility should work even on unsorted files.

This was done with the interview requirements:
- No external libs
- No LLMs
