# Uniq
This is a fully-fleged version of an interview exercise I made for Vanta.
The exercise consist of recreating the default functionality of the Linux command `uniq`, with the caveat that this utility should work even on unsorted files.

This was done with the interview requirements:
- No external libs
- No LLMs

I've also added some fairly large files to test performance on both algorithms

## Running
For the brute force version `pnpm run:naive` and for the external sorting version do `pnpm run:external-sort`

##Â Algorithms
- Brute force
- External sort (originally with Lose Tree but changed to use a min heap)
> NOTE: The MinHeap is unoptimized. Still the algorithm is muuuuuuuch faster
